## What is State

state is how something is

A component changes from one state to another over time when triggered by some kind of event.

Components that do not have state, that is there is no trigger that causes a transition, are called stateless.

# What is state (simple w/ water analogy)
https://thinkster.io/tutorials/understanding-react-state
“state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

What’s the difference between water and ice? Temperature
* With water, simply put it in your freezer (below 32F) and its state will change from liquid to a solid. 
* If you put it on a hot stovetop (above 212F), its state will change from liquid to gas.

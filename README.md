 # HTML
 When people asked do you know HTML? What they probably mean is do you know the properties of HTML tags like span and div? Do you the different properties i.e div vs span (block vs inline-block). Do you know how they behave when they are put together?

inline-block ex textarea, can extend multiple rows.

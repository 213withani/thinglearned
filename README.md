## Aha moments

# IDEs are there to help
I used want to memorize a lot of stuff ex main method in eclipse but I was surprised when Eclipse added this by default. Amazing. Now I use Visual Code and it is easier to write code. Type html and enter and you got the whole html template in your editor ready to start coding. You might need a plugin but you get the point.

 # HTML
 When people asked do you know HTML? What they probably mean is do you know the properties of HTML tags like span and div? Do you the different properties i.e div vs span (block vs inline-block). Do you know how they behave when they are put together?

inline-block ex textarea, can extend multiple rows.
